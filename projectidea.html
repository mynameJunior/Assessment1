      <h3>Overview</h3>
   <p>For my project proposal, I'm currently aiming for something that will, in my opinion, considerably improve the ease of travelling to new places, an everyday app that will make life easier. An application that, upon entering the suburb/ location, sends pertinent information about the area, such as weather, events, shop offers, announcements, and fuel prices, directly to the user's mobile phone. This application would also collect data about the area's history, such as crime statistics. Although there are other applications that display weather data, there aren't many that provide significantly greater detail over a greater amount of content.<br>Of course, it won’t be limited to only entering the area, you also have the option to type the locations name within the search bar, providing you with everything related with the area. Overall, saving you time going through different sources for each and every little bit of information. </p>
   <h3>Motivation</h3>
   <p>Consider the following scenario: you decide to relocate due to unforeseen circumstances, and you're unfamiliar with the area, so you decide to use the app. It informs you the nearest shopping centre with sales, the nearest petrol station with pricing, the current weather, and much more. This would make it so much easier for you to travel around.<br>I find this proposal to be useful in many cases, which would almost no doubt become an everyday app. It does the information gathering for the user, saving time and stress searching for one specific thing. Moving houses is almost always stressful, and according to sources, ‘more renters in our study tended to find moving to be stressful (84%), compared to owners of property (78%)’ (Budget Direct 2021, section. 2.6). In my opinion, I see this app having potential to be extremely useful for people who are thinking of or moving houses.  </p>
   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>This application that I can imagine within every mobile phone has the ambition and potential to help those who’re stressing over moving houses, or with the intentions of. This app will be designed to be incredibly simple to use and informative. Upon opening the app, a clean and simple search bar will show up centred on the mobile phone which will allow the user to enter the location which they wish to gather information of. Once the name has been entered, options for type of content they’re looking for will appear, providing the user with a easy way of finding the specific information they need according to the area they searched. This will be listed from first option on top to the last option on the bottom. They are shopping, petrol stations, events, educational facilities, crime statistics, and history. Each providing essential and relevant information such as:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>When clicking Shopping, another section of options will appear being more specific, breaking into clothing, food, jewellery, furniture, outdoors, electronics, and cosmetics. Depending on which one the user selected, it will display a map marking the location of all the shops, giving the user a links to their website for further Indepth facts about the store. </li>
     <li>Petrol stations will open a real time map marked with all station locations, obviously popping up a notice asking the user if they would like to enable real time tracking, if they need the assistance. </li>
     <li>Events include public festivals, public holiday events, local announcements, and carnivals. When the events date has been set the app will update accordingly, providing users with the time and location. </li>
     <li>Just like Shopping, Educational facilities will have another section fill the screen, being Schools (kindergarten, primary schools, and highs schools), Universities, and libraries. Every or rather almost everything related to the Education department. </li>
     <li>As of crime statistics, a bar graph will inform the user of how many crimes have been committed within the area. </li>
     <li>Lastly, History will open up websites with credible sources within the application, allowing for the user to stay within the app instead of opening an external app such as safari or google chrome. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Another thing is, while on the home screen, a notice will ask the user for permission to access to the users location, there is also a feature where the app automatically searches the locations name without having to search it themselves. Users can also save searches, allowing them to quicky access previous locations. </p>
   <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
   <p>The application will only operate on mobile phones, being IOS and Android. Using a Javascript framework, React Native, will allow the application to cross-platform between IOS, Android, and even windows, though the app will only be used for mobile devices. The implementation of Google Maps will be a main factor in majority of this apps functions. The app will also take advantage of its GPS tracking technology, which will provide the user with reliable real time tracking. The application will be built using a software called xCode that utilises a coding language called Swift. </p>
   <h3>Skills Required</h3>
   <p>The skills that would be essential in the applications Contruction would be in the area of a programmer. This would also be in the alleys of a Web developer, being experienced with similar and more challenging projects. Being able to properly utilise the coding program, Swift, would rather increase the chances of a successful project. In the sense of feasibility, assembling a competent team with the right skill sets will be the most logical option in springing this idea to life.  </p>
   <h3>Outcome</h3>
   <p>On the occasion that this application becomes successful, the likely category that makes up most of our users would be people moving/ thinking of moving house, and people how’re traveling to unfamiliar places. This app would greatly contribute in decreasing stress when relocating to foreign areas. Although majority of the mobile using population tend to turn to google maps for information on unfamiliar places, in most cases, they’re unfortunately forced to scour through irrelevant data. In which this app makes up for, gathering all relevant data regarding the users search. </p>
