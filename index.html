        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
      <p>My name is Nuulaiti Lale, as stated above, I come from a small island nation named Samoa. We still use a traditional chief system that runs under the Samoan government. Furthermore, everyone was taught for an early age “fa’a Samoa,” which translates to “the Samoan way.” I recently graduated in 2020 from Corinda State High while speaking both Samoan and English. Growing up in a Samoan family means playing rugby, I used to play for competitive teams under Melbourne storms including my own country. I later, unfortunately, dropped rugby due to Covid-19 restrictions that impacted our seasons schedule.</p>
        <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
        <p>Technology is advancing at an astonishing pace improving life as we know it. Wherever you look technology is involved. As someone who likes to understand the process and history of something's creation, it would be impossible to overlook IT. Playing on my pc and fiddling with my pc's components in hopes of troubleshooting an issue, have piqued my interest in pc building and components. I've decided to take this course in the sense of possibly having a career change. One main matter that interests me in the field of IT is its infinite possibilities of advancement. IT is the core of human continuation.</p> 

        <p>The year 2020 was the year I graduated from high school. I originally planned to begin my studies the following year but with the seriousness of Covid-19 financial problems began to rise and my plans were delayed. During the lockdown period, social media was my best friend, and exploring the internet became my main source of entertainment. It was during this time that I purchased and explored my very first pc, taking apart and getting to know more about the components main roles and how everything ties together. Learning while troubleshooting issues that appear here and there have inspired me to further my study with IT. Whilst working casual with full-time hours, Online RMIT was the best choice as Its flexible time schedule benefits me greatly.</p>
        
        <p>As a novice with only basic knowledge, I chose to study this subject to build a solid foundation in contemporary Information Technology areas, software, applications and job skills required to enter the IT market. With a well-built foundation, I hope to successfully describe and apply basic concepts of contemporary technologies, participate effectively and creatively in a team environment, and analyse the human and social contexts of technological innovations. </p>
